To run the IndiGolog architecture, you need to do the following:

1. Change the file lib/systemvar.pl to set your particular paths to
 some executables that may be used, such as SWI Prolog, ECLIPSE Prolog,
 xterm, etc. For example, SWI Prolog executable is assumed to be '/usr/bin/pl' 
 but it can be changed by modifying the executable_path/2 predicate in
 lib/systemvar.pl file.

2. TCP/IP is used for most applications (though not the Elevator-Vanilla).
   For SWI Prolog, make sure it is compiled with TCP/IP support. (This means
   that the library CLIB must be installed).

3. Extract indigolog-linux-vvv.tar.gz to some path <mypath> 
       cd <mypath>
       tar -xzf indigolog-linux-vvv.tar.gz
   where vvv is the version of Indigolog being installed. 

4. Set an environment variable PATH_INDIGOLOG to <mypath>/indigolog-linux-vvv
   For example, if <mypath> is /home/ssardina/code/ then in bash you do this:
       export PATH_INDIGOLOG=/home/ssardina/code/indigolog-linux-vvv

5. Set the right options for predicate executable_path/2 in file lib/systemvar.pl
so that IndiGolog knows where certain programs are (e.g., xterm)



For some applications, you will also need to do the following:

1. Install Tcl/Tk and the 'wish' executable.  (This is used by the simulator
   environment to enter exogenous actions.)

2. Install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your system.  Make sure that
   'java' invokes the Java application launcher.  Also, note that JRE1.5 from
   SUN is known to work, while the GNU Java Compiler (GJC) is reported to fail
   when executing the script at step 5.  (This is used in the Wumpus example.)

3. If the application uses ECLIPSE Prolog (e.g., Wumpus-FLUX), the environment
   variable ECLIPSELIBRARYPATH should be set to $PATH_INDIGOLOG/lib.
   This is where ECLIPSE will look for user libraries.
