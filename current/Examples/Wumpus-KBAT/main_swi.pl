% This is the top-level file for a Legolog application program.
% It consults all the necessary Legolog prolog files.
% In particular, the following is loaded:
%
%  (1) Load all libraries required. This includes the system dependant
%      ones for the specific Prolog plus general libraries
%  (2) Load the IndiGolog interpreter and the projector used
%  (3) Load the application code itself containing the background theory
%      of action plus the high-level program
%  (4) Specify which environments should be loaded and how 
%  (5) Specify how each action should be executed and how to translate
%      exogenous actions
%
% Moreover, the following is provided:
%
% -- main: Collects all the procedures named 'mainControl(id)' 
%	   and asks the user which one to run. Uses controller/1
%
