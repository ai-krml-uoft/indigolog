- Added two other construct for concurrency: 
	(suggested by Andrea & Stefano, from Rome)
	
		* rconc(L) : generalizes rconc(E1,E2) to list of programs L
		* itconc(L): concurrency by iterating on programs in list L
		
- Resolved clash between built-in list select/3 and eclipse compatibility
select/3 predicate for waiting for data on streams. 
The eclipse version has been renamed to stream_select/3.
