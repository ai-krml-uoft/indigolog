% -- main_dir(Dir) : main directory of the whole code

% This subsection does the following:
%  (a) provides main_dir(Path)
%  (b) loads the neccessary compatibility library: compat_ecl or compat_swi
%  (c) sets ` to be the string construct (using set_backquoted_string)


% Path is the root path of the IndiGolog system
% In SWI Pwd will be a string already
main_dir(Path):- getenv('PATH_INDIGOLOG',Pwd),
                 (string(Pwd) -> atom_string(APwd, Pwd) ; APwd=Pwd),
                 concat_atom([APwd, '/'], Path).
