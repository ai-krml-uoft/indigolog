%   IndiGolog vanilla interpreter
%
% First written by Hector Levesque
% Modified and adapted by Sebastian Sardina March 1999.
% This file contains vanilla Prolog code. If you run in a special Prolog
% platform you may want to consult indigolog-vanilla_xxx.pl where xxx is the
% corresponding Prolog implementation (e.g., SWI or ECLIPSE)
%
% This file contains the original IndiGolog interpreter
%
%   The main tool provided in this file is the following predicate:
%
% -- indigolog(E):  E is an IndiGolog program
%

%	continue execution inserting that exogenous action 
indigo(E,H) :- 	exog_occurs(Act), exog_action(Act), !, indigo(E,[Act|H]).

% (2) - Find a signle step (trans), execute it, commit and continue 
indigo(E,H) :- trans(E,H,E1,H1), indixeq(H,H1,H2), !, indigo(E1,H2).

% (3) - If E is final write the length of history H 
indigo(E,H) :- final(E,H), nl, length(H,N), write(N), write(' actions.'), nl.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% indixeq(H1,H2,H3): Implementation of execution of an action.
% 	H1 is the original history, H2 is H1 with the new action to be 
%	executed and H3 is the resulting history after executing such new 
% 	action. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% (1) - No action was performed so we dont execute anything 
indixeq(H,H,H). 
% (2) - The action is not a sensing one: execute and ignore its sensing 
indixeq(H,[Act|H],[Act|H]) :- \+ senses(Act,_), execute(Act,_).
% (3) - The action is a sensing one for fluent F: execute sensing action
indixeq(H,[Act|H],[e(F,Sr),Act|H]) :- senses(Act,F), execute(Act,Sr).
