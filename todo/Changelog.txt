- A few fixes performed for Stefano Valentini
	- Change data to be sent not quoted, so that terms can be sent (common.pl)
	- Fixed bug with closing of sockets; some remainde opened.
			- This was because close/1 was not macro expanded to eclipse_close/1
				when used within catch_succ/2

- Added construct atomic(E) to execute E atomically.
	- if E can make one step, E is put forward as the 1st program to do
	Obs: if E cannot later advance, the whole program fails!
	
- Introduced mfinal/2 and mtrans/4 in transfinal.pl as the top-level
	meta-level versions of final/2 and trans/4. Now, indigolog.pl uses
	these meta-level versions. These meta-level versions allow now to
	manipulate transitions in a more expressive way. As of now, it is
	only used to accommodate the new construct atomic(E) by moving
	E as the head of the whole program.

- Added two other construct for concurrency: 
	(suggested by Andrea & Stefano, from Rome)
	
		* rconc(L) : generalizes rconc(E1,E2) to list of programs L
		* itconc(L): concurrency by iterating on programs in list L
		
- Resolved clash between built-in list select/3 and eclipse compatibility
select/3 predicate for waiting for data on streams. 
The eclipse version has been renamed to stream_select/3.

===========================================================================

- Added predicate executable_path(A,P) in lib/system_var.pl which indicates
the path to different softwares (e.g. swi, xterm). It is used in
Env/dev_managers.pl to define device managers.
